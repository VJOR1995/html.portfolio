<h1>The Best Movies According to Von Jaime</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Back to the Future Trilogy</h3>
<p>I love the 80's vibe</p>
“Great Scott"!

<h3>300 Days of Summer</h3>
<p>Not a typical romance story</p>
"Some people are meant to fall in love with each other,<br>
but not meant to be together"<br>

<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy Trilogy</h3>
<p>Great casting and love the humor of this movie</p>
“There are the hands that made us,<br>
 and there are The Hands that guide the hands”<br>

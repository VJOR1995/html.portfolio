<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Von Jaime Resuta, a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in 
  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My journey into web development began through self-study and online courses. Since then, I've been dedicated to 
  honing my skills and exploring new technologies to create engaging and user-friendly websites.</p>

<p>I specialize in front-end development, with experience in frameworks like React and Vue.js,
   which I use to build responsive and dynamic web applications. I also have a solid understanding of back-end development using Node.js and Express, 
   allowing me to create robust APIs and integrate with databases like MongoDB and MySQL.</p>

<p>What excites me most about web development is the opportunity to turn ideas into reality and create seamless digital experiences that resonate with users. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute my problem-solving skills 
  and attention to detail to deliver high-quality projects.
  Outside of coding, I enjoy staying updated with the latest industry trends and exploring new technologies through online communities and developer meetups. 
  When I'm not at my computer, you can find me playing guitar and watching documentaries.
  I'm currently seeking opportunities to further grow and expand my skills in web development. 
  Let's connect and discuss how I can contribute to your next project!
